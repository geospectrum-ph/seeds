## About the Project

**SEEDs Web** is a project developed and maintained by **Geospectrum Analytics Services, Inc.**

### Framework

SEEDs Web is built using the Javascript programming language, through the full MERN stack of **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**, with **Vite.js** for the front-end development. MongoDB is a document-oriented database used to store the web application's data. Node.js and its web framework, Express.js, handles server-side requests and processes while React.js handles client-side functionalities and the user interface. The full-stack three-tier JavaScript-based architecture of the web application allows for efficiency during project development and maintenance and scalability in data handling and project management. The project utilizes multiple APIs and various open-source JavaScript-based libraries, including Leaflet for the visualization of spatial data and Material UI for the general front-end layout and properties of SEEDs Web.
